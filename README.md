# Smart-HEAP
Machine Learning Augmented Binary Heap Data Structure
Collaborators: Angelos Pelecanos and Adib Hasan

This is an augmented heap data structure that predicts future operations and optimizes the average cost accordingly. During our testing, we found that our heap does 40% less comparisons on average than classical binary heap. Further details are available in our [Medium blog post](https://medium.com/@thankful_rose_ferret_864/how-we-sped-up-the-binary-heap-with-machine-learning-e10b3204e4e6).
